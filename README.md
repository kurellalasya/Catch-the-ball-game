🎮 Catch the Ball Game – OpenCV Project
A fun, beginner-friendly computer vision game built using Python and OpenCV, where you catch a falling green ball with a blue paddle. The paddle is controlled in real-time by moving a red-colored object in front of your webcam!

📌 How It Works
A green ball falls from the top of the screen.

A blue paddle is placed at the bottom.

Move a red object (like a pen cap or cloth) in front of your camera — the paddle will follow it left or right.

Catch the ball with the paddle to score points!

The game continues until you press the ESC key to exit.
